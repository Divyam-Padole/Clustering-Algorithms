# Clustering Algorithms in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various clustering algorithms for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Algorithms Included

- **BRICH**: Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: A probabilistic model representing a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters.
- **K-means**: A method of vector quantization that partitions data into k clusters.
- **K-medoid**: A clustering algorithm that selects k representative objects as medoids.
